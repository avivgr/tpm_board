### Description

This is a KiCad project for a simple breakout PCB around the OPTIGA™ SLB 9670 TPM2.0 chip. The OPTIGA™ SLB 9670 TPM2.0 uses the SPI serial interface to a host. You can connect this board to a PC motherboard (using jumper wires), or to an SBC like the raspberry pi (more details below).

### Why?

Because there is a price hike on TPM2.0 boards due to Windows 11 requirements. Also, this is a great learning tool for TPM2.0 technology, instead of using a software emulated TPM.
